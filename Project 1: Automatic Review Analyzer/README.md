## Introduction
The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively. 

In order to automatically analyze reviews, we will need to complete the following tasks:

- Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

- Use our classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

- Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.
